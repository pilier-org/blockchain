# Changelog

All notable changes to the Pilier runtime, keyed by runtime `spec_version`. This file follows the
spirit of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). It records what changed and why for
node operators and integrators; it deliberately omits internal implementation and decision detail.

## [runtime 102] — 2026-07-19

### Added
- **Mutable validator set.** Validators can now be added to or removed from the active set by a
  supermajority (at least 75%) vote of the validators' council, with the root key retained as an
  emergency override. Previously the validator set was fixed at genesis and could not change
  without a new chain.

### Changed
- **Transaction fees are paid to the block author.** The full transaction fee now goes to the
  validator that produced the block, rather than being burned.

## [runtime 101]

### Changed
- **Transaction cost adjustment.** Reworked the transaction fee configuration.
